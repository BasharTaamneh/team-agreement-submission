- *The distribution of project tasks will be based on each person's strengths*

- *It was planned to give each person or two a daily task to complete in a special part of the project*

- *The repo has been built and the settings have been set up so that pull request will not be accepted unless all members of the project agree to it, as the pull will not be on the main brunch, but on the staging brunch.*

- *In the event of any conflicts when pulling, there will be basically a backup copy of the latest version of the work and it will be copied and the bugs will fixed*

- *In the event that any internal disputes arise, the team official will try to resolve them, and if he does not succeed in this, they will be escalated to the higher responsible parties.*


- *After giving each group in the team their own task, they will try to solve it in a certain time. If they can't, the other team members will help them anyway.*


- *If a team member does not contribute anything to complete the project, his speaking in the presentation will not be accepted.*

- *The communication period will be after the lab time until 12:00 a.m., according to the team membersâ€™ need for this, and this will be done through Zoom, phone number, Slack, WhatsApp.*

- *Each team member will be given absolute rest to express their opinion freely.* 
- *We'll use a PR review workflow:*
